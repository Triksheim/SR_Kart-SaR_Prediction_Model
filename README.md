# SR Kart - SaR Prediction Model

This repository is an integral component of 'SR Kart,' a tool developed as part of a bachelor's thesis at UiT The Arctic University of Norway. The project is designed to enhance Search and Rescue (SAR) operations through technological solutions.

'SR Kart' comprises:
- A server backend that powers a web application. This backend manages data storage and performs data analysis and processing to create a prediction model.
- Mobile applications for both Android and iOS platforms, designed to interface seamlessly with the backend for real-time operational use.

## Map analysis and prediction model
The specific focus of this repository is on data processing and analysis. It involves collecting various geographical data for defined areas and analysing this data to develop a predictive model. This model aims to identify the most optimal search areas, enhancing the likelihood of locating missing persons based on environmental and probabilistic factors.
